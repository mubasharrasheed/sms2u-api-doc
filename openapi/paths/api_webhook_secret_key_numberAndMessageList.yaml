    Endpoint Name: numberAndMessageList


    This is a GET request, which is used to retrieve data from a specified
    resource in a server.


    The URL for the request is:
    https://dashboard.sms2u.io/api/webhook/secret_key/numberAndMessageList. 


    This URL consists of the base URL (https://dashboard.sms2u.io/), api
    endpoint (/api/webhook/) and the path parameter
    (/secret_key/numberAndMessageList). This path parameter looks like a long
    string, which could be a user ID or some kind of unique identifier, but
    without additional context, we cannot be certain. 


    This request does not contain any header information. Headers are often used
    to provide additional parameters for the request or the return response, for
    example content-type or authentication information.


    This request uses Bearer Authentication, a HTTP authentication scheme that
    involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The bearer token is sent in
    the 'Authorization' header. The key is named "token" and the value is set to
    "BearerToken". The "type" indicates that our token's data type is a string. 


    This is the information you provide so the server knows the request comes
    from an authenticated user. Be careful to replace "BearerToken" with your
    actual Bearer token, the one you would get after a successful login or
    authentication, otherwise, the server would reject your request.
